Being able to research and learn everthing about your target is a mission-critical aspect of any penetration test.  One of the ways to gather information about a target is through Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT.  There are two main forms of OSINT: active and passive.  Active OSINT occurs when your computer makes some sort of connection to the target computer.  Passive OSINT uses other services to gather this data.  In this post I'll walk you through the basics of Passive OSINT

## Passive Footprinting:

## Whois

Whenever you register a new domain, its required to add an entry to the Whois database. This database provides some basic information about the owners of a specific domain name.  Many services are now available, howeer, to hide sensitive private information, but this is still a good place to start your OSINT.  We can use the `whois` command found in most linux distros to look up a domain:

```
$ whois briggselsperger.com 
   Domain Name: BRIGGSELSPERGER.COM 
   Registry Domain ID: 2219218811_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN

From the above scan we can determine:
  * DNS Servers (sometimes these may be located within the target's org)
  * Domain Name Expiry Date
  * Domain Name Registrar used

In some cases, additional information can be obtained with whois:
  * Names and/or email addresses of employees
  * Username and email formats, (ex. jdoe@company.com, john.doe@company.com)
  * Physical building locations


## Netcraft

[Netcraft](https://searchdns.netcraft.com/) is a web-based OSINT tool we can use to find the IP address of a website. It can also provide other information about the hosting provider, SPF Records, and (maybe most importantly) the tech stack of the website. We can use all of this later

## nslookup

Once we have the IP address of the target, we can dig further into the infrastructure.  A great way to get started with this is by using DNS to determine the IP address of a target.

```
$ nslookup www.briggselsperger.com 
Server:        1.1.1.1 
Address:    1.1.1.1#53 
  
Non-authoritative answer: 
Name:    www.briggselsperger.com 
Address: 18.188.50.45
```

This simple can tells us two useful tidbits of information:
  * We are using `1.1.1.1` DNS nameserver (Thanks, Cloudflare!)
  * The target's website IP is `18.188.50.45`

## Whois (Reloaded)

Now that we have an IP address to get started, we can run whois again on that IP to gather even more information about the target:

```
$ whois 18.188.50.45

This new scan gives us two more pieces of information:
  * Who owns the server
  * What IP Ranges the target owns
